Description:
This is the version of the BRISC-V processor submitted for the EC513 project.
It implements a 5 stage pipeline with stalls/flushes. No cache is integrated
yet.

This version has been cleaned up and was the starting point for the bypassed
pipeline version. The BRISC-V_5_stage_pipeline_stall_bypass version should
replace this version as a starting point for future additions.

Features:
- 5 stage pipeline
    - 2 nops after JAL/JALR/any branch
- Small, fixed size memories
    - 2048 words per memory
    - make sure stack pointer is small enough
    - setting stack pointer to 450 works in demos
    - TODO: Add memory size parameter. I believe this should be separate from the
            ADDRESS_BITS parameter.
- Signed shift bug in ALU has been fixed
- No peripherals are included
- No Cache

Updates:

The signed ALU bugs have been fixed. All ALU operations are now
correctly implemented as signed or unsigned.

The PC wire reset behavior has been moved from combinational to clocked logic to
allow instruction memory to be infered as BRAM.
